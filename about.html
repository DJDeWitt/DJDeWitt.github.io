  					<p>Hey there, my name DJ. Nice to meet you!<br><br>I am a Consumer, Curator, and Creator of Media and Technology. I'm learning to code so that I can make things that empower individuals and make the world a kinder, more fair, more empathetic place.<br><br>For the past year, I worked for a technology startup here in Chicago, learning about the Chicago technology community and how a small group of individuals can create solutions for pressing human problems.<br><br>Finally, it came time for me to set out and make my own impact using technology. After some soul-searching and some web searching, I came across Dev Bootcamp, an environment full of people who shared my values and ambitions and who would challenge me to learn the skills I would need to use my intellect, kindness, and curiosity to make the lives of others better.<br><br>This is only the start of my journey, so I encourage you to bookmark this site and check in often - I'll be updating you on my progress as I learn how to become a developer. If you'd like to meet, please visit my <a href="./contact.html">Contact page</a> and we can talk about this exciting future in person.</p>
