If you’ve started to look into how the technology we use every day is programmed, you’ve probably come across one of the catchiest phrases, “Ruby on Rails”. What exactly does this alliterate phrase mean, though? How do people “use” Ruby on Rails to create immensely popular web experiences like Twitter, Groupon, IndieGoGo, and Airbnb?
<br><br>
“Ruby on Rails” refers to the intersection of two components: Ruby, a programming language, and Rails, an open-source web framework. To understand Ruby on Rails is to understand these two components, and to understand why so many famous companies have used Ruby on Rails is to understand the benefits afforded to developers by the intersection of these two components.
<br><br>
Ruby is a programming language known for its easy and versatility, and Rails is an open-source web application framework written in Ruby. A web framework is essentially an extension of a programming language (known here as the Rails API) that combines the base language with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the hard labor of hundreds of programmers in order to make it easier for people to build complex and dynamic web applications and services, like the aforementioned websites that were built with Rails.
<br><br>
Ruby on Rails offers a number of benefits that lead developers to choose it over other language-framework combinations. Most notably, Rails emphasizes a few critical software engineering practices:
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>1.  Convention over Configuration (CoC): This approach reduces the amount of code a programmer needs to write, as instead of writing additional software configuration files for their program, they merely need to rely on the language’s native procedures, functions, classes and variables.</li>
<li>2.  Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY): This approach seeks to simplify code by emphasizing best practices that eliminate repetition.</li>
<li>3.  Active Record Pattern: This is an approach to accessing data in a database. With this approach, objects carry both persistent data and behavior which operates on that data, so objects that have data access logic will be more useful to users looking to read and write from the database.</li>
<li>4.  Model-View-Controller (MVC): A software pattern for implementing user interfaces, separating out and facilitating a flow between the internal representations of information and how that information is presented to the user.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
In short, Ruby on Rails emphasizes simplicity, elegance, and usability; programmers have to write less code and have more implicit behaviors that reduce the amount of work they have to do to get things working.
<br><br>
The future of the program is on the web; the rise of social networks and smartphones, a decreasing cost and wider access to Internet services and Cloud-based storage technologies, all of these innovations and changes in cultural expectations mean that programmers will be expected to have a knowledge not only of programming languages, but the web frameworks that will be essential to the development of new technologies.
<br><br>
This is no more apparent than in the phrase “Ruby on Rails” itself. For many people, Ruby is inextricably tied to Rails, a useful language to learn strictly because of the Rails web framework. It is a young framework as well, popular with new programmers and young technology companies, and as such it’s emphasis on dynamic web development is a clear picture of what the future of programming will look like.
