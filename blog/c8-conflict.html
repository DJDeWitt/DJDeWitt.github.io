Learning about the compass of shame hits close to home, because dealing with shame and guilt is one of my most difficult challenges. I can easily pinpoint times where I have been at each point on the compass, often fluctuating from one point to another within a single conflict.
<br><br>
Recently, I had an emotional conflict with a friend. To understand this conflict, you need to understand that I’m an extremely sensitive person; my strength is my weakness, my ability to empathize and connect with others is matched my ability to internalize their emotional condition. 
<br><br>
This sensitivity causes me to avoid conflict, partly because I feel the heat of it very intensely, and partly because I put myself in the shoes of the other person and am able to rationalize why engaging in conflict is unjustified, on my part. This is similar to “Attack Self” on the compass; I figure out how I would be in the wrong in a conflict, often to the point that I believe it, often sending me into deeper guilt.
<br><br>
My friend likes to criticize people, partly for humor, and partly because he believes it is how he can encourage (or shame) the people around him into being better people. These micro-aggressions took a toll on me because of my sensitivity, but I didn’t say anything because I wanted to avoid conflict. 
<br><br>
This was the real source of the problem; my inability to speak honestly about the way my friend was affecting me allowed that pain to build up over time. Upset, I would either stop hanging out with him entirely, or I would turn to some engaging activity (video games, a girlfriend) to ignore how upset I was getting.
<br><br>
Finally, I was forced into a situation where I couldn’t escape the needling, so “Withdrawal” and “Avoidance”, the north and south parts of the compass, were out of the question. I couldn’t “Attack Self” because I was forced into a position where I had to defend myself, so I ultimately turned to “Attack Other”, the west side of the compass.
<br><br>
What’s important to understand here is that I am used to constantly trying to empathize with and understand how my presence – the words I say, how I act, what I do – affects other people. As a result, insensitivity – when people are close-minded or fail to see how their words or actions affect other people – really upsets me. 
<br><br>
Over the course of many months, I had sustained many, many micro-aggressions, internalized them, and even believed them to be legitimate. In that moment of “Attack Other”, I wanted to level at my friend an attack that would make him feel the weight of everything I had felt; I wanted him to finally learn how his words affect people, by making him feel similarly.
<br><br>
This, of course, shocked him, and upset him, and we stopped speaking. It wasn’t until the wounds we had both dealt each other started to heal that we were able to come back to each other and apologize for what we did, vowing that we would from now on communicate how we feel if something we said upset the other person.
<br><br>
Of course, if I could go back, I would come to this conclusion from the beginning. I still don’t like being the initiator of conflict, but it’s clear to me from this experience that engaging in small, healthy conflicts is all part of avoiding the bigger, nastier ones.
