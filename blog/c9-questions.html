“Tell the Universe what you need. The Universe is generous.”
<br><br>
I like this quote a lot. I picked it up a few years back from one of my friends; he said he got it from a Futurama episode (he, self-admittedly, gets everything from Futurama episodes), but I googled it and the (literally) only hit was a <a href="http://follr.me/djdewitt/about">Follr page</a> I don’t remember making.
<br><br>
The Universe is generous though, and it gave me this quote, and a whole lot more. That’s because, somewhere along the way, I learned how to tell the Universe what I need. This, of course, doesn’t mean standing in a field, looking up at the stars, and whispering your deepest desires into the brisk night sky. It means recognizing that everything that composes your universe – your friends, your family, strangers, entities, experiences – can be learning opportunities. You just have to learn how to ask.
<br><br>
<h4>How to ask</h4>
<br><br>
If you are receptive to others and honest with yourself about your own ignorance you can empower yourself to grow as an individual. This is always the first step in asking a great question; it begins with your humility and your desire to grow (feedback doesn’t count for much if you don’t apply it in some way).
<br><br>
Once you’ve identified an issue you are struggling with and have given yourself time to work at the problem, you can reach out to others to help you solve it. First, you should outline clearly what your problem was, providing all the information (including exact code, documents, intentions, etc.) that you have at your disposal. This could ultimately be a lot of code, so you need to identify what level of detail you should provide to help focus the issue (for example, you may want to provide the specific code for one section, while outlining what other sections of the code do so they have the full picture).
<br><br>
You also need to be clear about what you want the working solution to be able to do, and, more importantly, what level of detail you want out of the solution. Are you looking for any solution? Multiple or alternative solutions that have certain standards for versatility or use certain types of logic? Are you looking for a hint, or a general area to start studying to find the thread yourself? If you make it clear what you’re asking for, you’re more likely to get the right answer from your first responders.
<br><br>
Finally, always remember to be gracious with those who try to help. Say thank you even if someone doesn’t give you the answer you’re looking for, or is unable to resolve it. Chances are, others will be helping you for free, and the kindness of a helpful community is ultimately what drives it and causes it to thrive.
