  		<p>
There are three values that I believe living up to will lead to a happy and productive life: Activism, creativity, and empathy. The most important of these, however, is activism, as it is a value that synthesizes creativity – the ability to bring new ideas into the world – and empathy – the ability to understand and accept different life experiences – in order to make life safer and more rewarding for others.
<br>
I have successes and shortcomings with each of my core values. A lot of people are appropriately skeptical of slacktivism; all issues need leaders who take an active, involved role in organizing others and creating tangible change. At the same time, the slacktivism that has grown proportionally to the popularity of social networks is really just another product of the democratizing power of the Internet; it is now easier than ever for others to learn about social justice issues and share this knowledge and their opinions with others. And in a world where people are influenced by the feelings and experiences of those within their network, slacktivism has a very real power to effect behavior, and, therefore, effect change.
<br>
I’m good at slacktivism – I learn and I signal boost – but I have a bad habit of going broad, not deep, in all aspects of my life. This means that I spend a lot of time evolving myself and sharing this knowledge, but I don’t act on this knowledge by becoming involved in the issues I care about. I don’t go to rallies, I’m not part of organizations, and the only teaching I’m doing is in the classroom of social media. I need to take a more involved approach to activism, which means I need to determine where my talents and interests can contribute best and commit to that line of work.
<br>
When it comes creativity, I start a lot of projects that I don’t finish. I’m always – always – working on something (a song, a game, a drawing, a short story, etc.), improving my technical and storytelling abilities, but I’m not putting in the extra effort required to bring a creative project that has long since changed from fun to work into the finish line. I need to learn that finished is often better than perfect, and that it’s okay to ask for help on projects that need it.
<br>
When it comes to empathy, I’m proud of the growth I’ve made as an individual – a litmus test I often use is how embarrassed I am of the person I used to be and the beliefs that person used to have. I try hard to recognize my biases when they kick in and expose myself to new voices that can help me break down those biases. If there’s one thing I’ve learned though, it’s that however open-minded I think I am now, there are many undiscovered biases I have yet to conquer.
<br>
If I could put into words a life philosophy that encapsulates the core values of activism, creativity, and empathy, it would be as follows: “Live in such a way as to realize your passions while empowering others to realize their passions.” To do this, you need empathy to understand the life experiences of those different from you, the activism to challenge the obstacles that prevent others from finding health and self-actualization, and the creativity to develop new solutions (social and technological) to help tear down discriminatory systems and ideologies.
<br>
When I think about these values, I can’t help but think about how much more I need to do. I’m an immensely privileged individual, and it is my responsibility to recognize, challenge, and dismantle the obstacles that others have to face that I have not had to struggle with. This means that I have to recognize manifestations of harmful concepts like stereotype threat in my every day, and do what I can call them out in a way that is productive and kind. This means that I have to be willing to stand up for those who don’t have autonomy and take to task those who wish to preserve the status quo. And, above all, this means I have to keep learning, keep creating, and keep acting in a way that makes life safer and more rewarding for others.
