     There are many systemic obstacles that are at the heart of racial and gender gaps in education and the workplace, but one of the most insidious forms of discrimination can force individuals to actualize negative stereotypes about groups they identify with. We call this form Stereotype Threat, and this post will seek to provide some advice for those privileged enough to not have to feel the damaging effects of this discriminatory practice.
<br><br>
<h4>Identifying Stereotype Threats</h4>
<br><br>
At the root of all stereotype threats is a commonly held negative stereotype about a group. For example, a commonly held stereotype is that women are unsuited for studying STEM or underperform in STEM work positions. Even if a woman doesn’t subscribe to this stereotype, the presence of it can activate an anxiety that causes her to underperform anyway. 
<br><br>
This can lead to a grim self-fulfilling process, where the presence of stereotypes cause individuals to reinforce those stereotypes, leading those who are unable to recognize the stereotype to believe that the stereotypes are valid. Therefore, learning to identify stereotype threats is critical to not only helping individuals perform better, but also dismantling the stereotypes at the root of these threats.
<br><br>
<h4>Reducing Stereotype Threats</h4>
<br><br>
Stereotype threat typically occur at moments of assessment, such as standardized tests in school or performance review in the office. Unfortunately, this means that it can often feel like it is impossible to challenge stereotype threats without being a position of power within these environments, such as a teacher or boss. Luckily, there are some basic things anyone can do to combat this discrimination:
<br><br>
<li>
<ol>1. Acknowledge language that reinforces stereotypes: Gendered or racial language can often trigger negative stereotypes. Being mindful of how you communicate and making sure that the language you use is comfortable with your peers can create a more safe and productive environment for everyone.</ol>

<ol>2. Provide opportunities for affirming self-worth: It is easy for individuals to ignore overwhelming positive feedback in favor of isolated negative feedback. Encourage those around you to reflect on their contributiosn by expressing your appreciation for their hard work, intelligence, kindness, and support.</ol>

<ol>3. Understand the reasons for learning struggle or difficulty: When individuals struggle with a challenge, it is far too easy for communication to break down, which can lead to moments of quiet self-doubt. To prevent this, show others that it is okay to be open about confusion and it is natural to encountere difficulties, and then work to address the specific reasons why this difficulty is occurring, and what can be done to resolve it.</ol>

<ol>4. Identify and expose individuals to role models that challenge negative stereotypes: The easiest way to break down stereotypes is to expose yourself to the many, many examples that challenge these ignorance-based assumptions. Every time you identify a new stereotype threat, find individuals or situations that challenge that stereotype, so that you can introduce them to others who may also be feeling the negative effects of that stereotype.</ol>
</li>
<br><br>
Stereotype threats are just one of many obstacles those in marginalized groups face on a daily basis. It is everyone’s responsibility to identify these obstacles and do whatever is in their power to reduce their presence in educational and workplace environments.
