      There’s a pretty good chance that if you’re reading this, you’re not an executive of a technology company. Even though social networks like <a href=” http://www.businessinsider.com/drag-queens-arent-the-only-people-affected-by-facebooks-real-name-policy-2014-9”>Facebook</a>, <a href=” http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/30/5952135/twitter-harassment-problems”>Twitter</a>, and <a href=” http://pando.com/2014/08/01/secret-founder-doesnt-care-if-teenagers-kill-themselves-as-long-as-they-dont-cause-him-a-pr-headache/”>Secret</a> have serious problems enabling user harassment, you are probably not in a position to tell the development team that addressing these issues should be their top priority. Even though major tech companies like <a href=” http://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2014/08/13/apple-ceo-tim-cook-is-not-satisfied-with-employee-diversity/”>Apple</a>, <a href=” http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/05/28/google-releases-employee-diversity-figures/9697049/”>Google</a>, and <a href=” http://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-releases-diversity-stats-says-much-work-still-to-be-done/”>Microsoft</a> are struggling with representation and diversity, you’re probably not in any position to hire more diverse voices. And you probably aren’t well-connected with the tech elite, which means they probably won’t listen to you when you try to explain to them that <a href=” http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/microsofts-ceo-and-the-worst-career-advice-imaginable/381312/”>telling women not to ask for raises</a>, <a href=” http://gawker.com/i-do-not-know-one-person-who-is-happy-at-amazon-1572478351”>cultivating a draconian corporate culture</a>, are problematic positions.
<br><br>
You may one-day be empowered to combat these issues directly, but that doesn’t mean you should feel hopeless about your ability to bring about a better tech culture. Here are four simple rules for focusing your efforts and creating a more positive, empathetic, and informed community.
<br><br>
<h4>1. Expose Yourself To More Diverse Voices…</h4>
<br><br>
Empathy is a skill; it will make you a better worker and a better person. Unfortunately, building empathy is like building muscle, you have to work it every day if you want to retain it.
<br><br>
So how do you build empathy? It’s actually pretty simple; you are what you eat. Writers, composers, and filmmakers are ravenous, critical consumers of the media they create. If you want to be a more empathetic person, you have to expose yourself to a diversity of opinions that break down your biases and challenge your understanding of issues.
<br><br>
If you don’t think something is “That Big Of A Deal”, and other people do, then you probably aren’t very informed on the subject. Instead of picking up the megaphone and getting in a shouting match, tell yourself that it is okay to not have an opinion, and search for expert sources on the topic. You can easily google these lists, but a great place to start would be my <a href=””>growing list of must-follow voices on Twitter</a>.
<br><br>
<h4>…And Believe Them When They Speak.</h4>
<br><br>
Death threats have driven at least three women out of their homes since #Gamergate started, a harassment campaign (largely focused on targeting women) masquerading as a call for improved journalistic integrity in video games. Each of those women has been accused of faking the death threats, the hacking, and the abuse they have received over the past few months. One of these women, Anita Sarkeesian, <a href=”http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/13/6145169/anita-sarkeesian-shares-the-most-radical-thing-you-can-do-to-support”>gave a talk at XOXO this summer</a> explaining the astonishingly simple way you can help support marginalized groups: believe them when they speak.
<br><br>
<h4>2. Know When To Speak Up…</h4>
<br><br>
Most people agree that arguing on the internet is a no-win game. “Don’t feed the trolls” and “Don’t read the comments” have become tried-and-true methods for preserving your mental health and your faith in humanity, but they also have become <a href=”http://blog.codinghorror.com/please-read-the-comments/”>a signifier of our acceptance of and general silence on</a> how disgusting and dark a vast majority of the Internet is capable of being. In our willful ignorance, we let a problem fester that causes real-world harm.
<br><br>
This is why a good ally is willing to engage with the hateful, harassing forces of the Internet so that victims don’t have to feel so alone. Each voice makes the light shine a little brighter, and, who knows, you just might actually open someone’s eyes to the problems so many women, LGBT, and PoC face on a daily basis in technology. 
<br><br>
That said, don’t rope victims into conversations with harassers. This is an especially important rule for Twitter, where it is far too easy to expose someone to hateful, triggering content simply by @-mentioning them.
<br><br>
<h4>…and Know When To Signal Boost.</h4>
<br><br>
Marginalized voices can speak for themselves, they just aren’t given the platform and trust that their male/straight/white counterparts receive. When an <a href=”http://readwrite.com/2014/10/09/technology-sexism-male-allies-grace-hopper-celebration”>all-male panel with questionable participants are lecturing a room full of women on representation and workplace equality at a women’s technology conference</a>, it’s time to get off the stage and let others speak. If you want to learn, you have to listen, and if you’ve found a voice particularly valuable, recommend her for conferences and other speaking opportunities so that others can be exposed to her.
<br><br>
<h4>3. Ally Is An Action…</h4>
<br><br>
Recently, a fracking company <a href=”http://ecowatch.com/2014/10/08/pinkwashing-susan-korman-baker-hughes/”>made their drill bits pink</a> for breast cancer awareness (“The mole people don’t do enough for breast cancer, and we’re going to change that!”) It’s only the latest in a series of events that have many questioning whether the term ally is used more for brand-boosting identity than actual, actionable change. The lesson here is simple: Being an ally doesn’t just mean you believe in improving tech culture for marginalized groups, it means actually doing something about it, in whatever way you can. For some fresh ideas, check out the following resources:

</ul>
<br><br>
<h4>…Not An Identity.</h4>
<br><br>
If you are vocal about activist/social justice issues, there is a chance you will eventually express an opinion that lacks nuance. That’s okay! As media and technology critic Leigh Alexander writes in her <a href=”http://leighalexander.net/but-what-can-be-done-dos-and-donts-to-combat-online-sexism/”>guide to combatting online sexism</a>:
<br>
<blockquote>…regardless of gender, all of us have been sexist before and will probably be again, as sexism, like racism, is unconscious and related to the values we internalize in our societies growing up. If someone tells you you are being sexist or racist, it is not a slur against your character, but an opportunity to learn more about yourself and others. We should all be interested in continuing to read, learn and share with those around us.</blockquote>
<br><br>
Being an ally is, by definition, putting the problems of others before your own. If you are finding yourself spending more time defending your allyship than actually supporting marginalized voices and challenging discriminatory systems, it might be time to rethink whether you are being productive with your time and energy. And if someone calls you out on an opinion, take it for the feedback that it is and use to make yourself a smarter, more empathetic person. The most powerful thing you can say to a critic is “Thank you.”
<br><br>
<h4>4. Take Care Of Yourself</h4>
<br><br>
All of that being said, the fight for safety and equality in technology is a marathon, not a sprint. For the sake of your mental and physical health, take the time you need to bow out if you’re feeling overwhelmed or exhausted.
<br><br>
Just remember, the people you are fighting for don’t have the luxury of turning it off. They can’t turn in for the night. They can’t disengage, and even if they don’t believe these problems exist, it will still affect them, because many of these issues are systemic or deeply rooted in personal biases. And as capable as these voices are on their own, they also need allies, and doing your part, no matter who you are, can do unimaginable good.
