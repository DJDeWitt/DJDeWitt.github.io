      One of the first things I noticed about the DBC way of doing things is that the approach to success was utterly different from what I had experienced in my previous academic learning environments. When all of a curriculum’s learning is synthesized down to the letters A through F and the numbers 1 through 100, your relationship to your teacher, your fellow students, and your education changes.
<br><br>
Like I was saying, DBC does things differently. It aims to create an environment where every element of the experience – your instructors, your fellow students, and the challenges – all serve the goal of helping you learn. How does it do this when the technical challenges are, for the most part, what you’d expect out of a coding curriculum? Two answers: Pairing and Feedback.
<br><br>
<h4>The Power of the Pair</h4>
<br><br>
Pairing is fairly self-explanatory: You work with a partner to solve a challenge. Sure, you’ve probably paired with fellow students on class projects before right? Well the DBC way provides more structure so you get actual value out of your partner’s presence, instead of the usual accompanying frustration. 
<br><br>
First, DBC recognizes that empathy is key to successful collaboration; each pairing session I’ve participated in has started out with five to ten minutes of just talking, first about background, then about our days, how we’re feeling, how the week’s challenges have been, any fears or concerns or difficulties we’ve had, etc. We humanize one another and discover each other’s competencies and weaknesses. Knowing this information, we can help each other in ways that are actually significant.
<br><br>
Second, DBC uses the driver-navigator relationship to maximize the value each partner can provide one another, all while reducing errors in the finished code. Essentially, a driver will write the actual code, and the navigator will tell the driver what to write. Each pairing session I’ve had has had a period where we discuss some ground rules for the driver-navigator relationship, who would like to take what role based on our comfort with the topic, and if we’d like to switch at any point. This way we know what we expect from one another, based on our skill sets. It builds trust, creates a more efficient working relationship, and allows each member of the pair to learn as much as possible from the other person.
<br><br>
In short, the DBC way for Pairing is immensely rewarding and significantly reduces the miscommunication, mistrust, and frustration that usually accompanies paired work.
<br><br>
<h4>Filtering Feedback</h4>
<br><br>
Instead of throwing arbitrary scores and grades at you, the DBC way for acquiring a firm education is rooted in its approach to feedback. 
<br><br>
First of all, all feedback given and received has to be Actionable, Specific, and Kind. This means that all feedback is something you can incorporate into how you work, is rooted in a specific event that occurred so you have a touchstone for what to do or not to do, and kind, so that you can take it in good faith that this feedback comes from an honest place and is intended to help you grow.
<br><br>
Feedback doesn’t just come from instructors though. Every pairing partner will give you feedback, and you will even get meta-feedback on the feedback you give your partners. This way you not only improve thanks to actionable, specific, and kind feedback, but the quality of feedback you provide also improves, creating a feedback loop (pun intended) that makes everyone relationship increasingly more valuable. Of course, the key to giving great feedback, I’ve found, is overcoming the struggle to speak in generalities; generalities can either lead to kind but unhelpful positive statements or cruel and unnecessary negative statements.
<br><br>
The feedback I’ve received has been, by and large, very positive. A reoccurring theme is that I do tend to ramble, which means I need to be willing to pause when I’m talking or pause and synthesize my thoughts before speaking. This feedback is beneficial to me, because I’m able to take it and combine it with my own understanding of myself (I ramble when I’m trying to make the mood lighter or when I’m trying to over-explain a point of confusion).
<br><br>
Overall, Pairing and Feedback are, in my opinion, the secret weapons that DBC employs to create a highly effective learning environment. Using these two simple tools, you are empowered by everything and everyone around you to grow as a programmer and an individual.
