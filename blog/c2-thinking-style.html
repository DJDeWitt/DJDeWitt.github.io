  		<p>
      In my first week of Dev Bootcamp, I wrote about my excitement and trepidation at redirecting my life course so drastically. Here I was, stepping away from a path that was laid out and familiar, looking down the less-traveled road and thinking to myself, “This is what I always told myself I should be doing, and now that I’m doing it, what if I fail? What if I was wrong?”<br><br>The last three weeks have seen me trudge down this path of roots and rocks and all sorts of other obstacles that would threaten to cause me to stumble, to second-guess myself, and to doubt my abilities. The last three weeks have been about finding my footing, and overcoming the fear that comes with traveling down any darkened and unknown road.<br><br>I walk more confidently now. There were challenges I struggled with, and concepts I understood, but three weeks in has given me enough to take on to teach me that, yes, I can handle this, yes I can write programs that throw zero exceptions, yes, I can think logically, yes, I can learn new skills and, most importantly, I can absolutely love doing it – especially when it’s not easy.<br><br>According to the test we took at the beginning of Dev Bootcamp, my thinking style is Abstract Random. This means that I like to organize information through reflection, and that I thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments. I’m not surprised that this is the case – the wispy reflection on display even in this blog post is how I process my experiences, an example of my introversion, and the desire to collaborate and experiment with others, as I have done in my pairing sessions, is a great manifestation of my extroversion.<br><br>I’m going to be needing both of these sides of my personality to continue to succeed at Dev Bootcamp. I feel immensely confident in my abilities after the first three weeks, but this is only the beginning, and the hardest of challenges are ahead of us. I’m going to need to reflect more regularly so that I commit the knowledge we learn at this fast-pace to memory. I’m going to need to collaborate more with my fellow boots as the challenges become more difficult, and give us the time and space we need to experiment with new ideas.<br><br>There’s a lot more to do, and I will need to continue to refine my learning processes to really take advantage of everything Dev Bootcamp has in store for us. For now though, I finally feel like my aspirations have been validated, and that, even though the road may be bumpy, I’m right where I’m meant to be.
