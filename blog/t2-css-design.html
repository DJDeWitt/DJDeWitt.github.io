        Ask any website designer and they'll tell you one of the trickiest parts of bringing their vision to life is getting every element on the page exactly where they want it. Unlike painting on a canvas, the programmer's brush cannot be picked up and set down just anywhere - each stroke (whether that stroke be a paragraph, an image, or some other HTML object) must be carefully positioned in relation to every other element of the design.<br><br>Thankfully, CSS gives us a number of properties that can be manipulate to get your website looking just right. We call these properties, collectively, the CSS box model. Why the box model? Because it essentially states that every element of content on your website is surrounded by a number of boxes; specifically, Margins, Borders, and Padding.<br><br>
        <img src="http://www.w3schools.com/css/box-model.gif" align="right"><br><br>
        As you can see in the image, There is a white box surrounding the content area, separating the content area from the green border area. Imagine you are packing a special item into a box to ship off somewhere - you would surround the special item in padding, separating it from the walls of the box, which could be pierced or jostled. This works the same way, except that the special item could be any HTML object, and the padding is invisible, instead of bubblewrap.<br><br>
        The border is exactly what you'd expect - a border that can be rendered around your HTML object to make it stand out in any number of ways. The margins can be thought of as 'reverse padding'; while the padding keeps your content away from the borders of the box, the margins keep your box away from the edges of other CSS box models on your page!<br><br>
        Hopefully this has given you a clearer understanding of the CSS box model, and how margins, borders, and padding are used to separate the various elements of your web pages from one another. To learn more about the specific code you can write to manipulate these CSS box model properties, check out <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp">this incredibly helpful resource</a> over at w3schools.
