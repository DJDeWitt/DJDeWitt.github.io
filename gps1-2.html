                <h2>What is pair programming?</h2>
                <p>Pair programming is a programming technique wherein two programmers work 
                on the same code simultaneously. 
                The roles of each programmer in the pair are differentiated. 
                In the most common pattern, one programmer acts as the driver 
                and the other acts as the navigator.</p>

              <h2>DJ's reflection:</h2>
              <p>Pair programming on this GPS was really great! I think Vincent and I worked really well together, communicating how we were feeling, how comfortable we were with different topics, and how we each best liked to hammer through problems in a pair programming relationship.</p><p>It was especially interesting to see us switch up Driver-Navigator roles fairly early in, so that we could tackle the web page in a way that had us in the roles we were best-suited for (Vincent is more comfortable with divs, I'm more comfortable with tables). This worked out in our favor, because I was able to help Vincent out with tables, and Vincent was able to visually walk me through his coding style, showing me best practices for tags, new properties to beautify the site, and hot-keys to make working in sublime more fun and efficient.</p>

              <h2>Vincent's reflection:</h2>
              <p>It was a lot of fun! We were very productive and exceeded both of our expectations. I think we both learned a few tricks from each other (e.g. the use of tables, or borders to test positioning), so that was cool.</p>
              <p>At first we were heading for a div based layout but we decided early on to move over to tables. That was good because I learned a lot about tables and their use. They're certainly a lot easier to position than divs, but I feel like they're not as flexible either.</p>
