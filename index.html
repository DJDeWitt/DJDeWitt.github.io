  					<p>A few experiences:</p>
  					<ul>
  						<li>Over the last year, I worked as Content Services Specialist, and later Head of Service Delivery, for Tempesta Media, one of Chicago's most successful new tech companies.</li>
  						<li>Over the last decade, I've built up a very particular set of skills...designing independent video games!</li>
  						<li>In 2013, I graduated from Northwestern University with a double major in English Literature and International Studies. Now, I put my writing skills to good use ranting out prose in blog format - some of which you'll be able to find on this very site.</li>

  			<!-- Interests -->
  			<tr>
  				<td colspan="2">
  					<p>A few interests:</p>
					<ol>
  						<li>I'm a huge media/news junkie: I'm deeply interested in education and storytelling, and I voraciously consume movies, music, games, books, and my Twitter feed (check out some of the people I follow for hot scoops).</li>
  						<li>I'm an activist: I'm an incredibly privileged person who has had unbelievable opportunities. I want to use what I've been given to break down systemic barriers and empower those who are less fortunate than me.</li>
  						<li>I'm passionate...and zen: Spend thirty seconds on my Facebook profile and you'll see I can get pretty heated about the issues I care about. That said, stepping back, relaxing, and having a good time is an essential part of who I am.</li>
